# Blackjack Game made using Python

Blackjack is a popular card game played in most of the casino.This is an intuition to replicate the same card game using Python programme.
This code uses the command line for taking the inputs from the users to be interactive.

## Module Used:
Modules in Python can have some classes, functions and variables. 
- In this **Python Project** I have used **Random** module so that the cards should dealt not be biased for Player and Dealer. 
- In Random module **random.choice()** is used to select a card from the card deck.

## Concepts used :
- Used the concepts of **Conditional statements** (if and else), **Looping statements** (for and while) 
- Used **Functions** to cut down the repetitive coding of the same conditions.
